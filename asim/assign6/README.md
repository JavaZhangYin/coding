COSC 1560 Computer Programming II
Fall Semester 2014
Assignment 6, United Cause Case Study, Due Thursday, October 9, 2014

The object of this assignment is to modify a program to use pointers and dynamic allocation. (re)read Section 10.13 (pages 678-686) of the text, then do Programming Challenges 3 and 4 on page 693 of the text. Combine them into one submission. 

Note the following:
for Challenge 3, you need to modify program10-19.cpp to request the number of donations, dynamically allocate the funds array (not the donations array as it says in the problem), and input the values from the keyboard.

The text versions are linked below.
- program10-19.cpp
- donlist.h
- donlist.cpp

For Challenge 4, you need to modify the selectSort function in donlist.cpp (it is a very minor modification)

Since you are simply modifying files provided by the author, the Webster style requirements do not apply here. Style will not be scored on this assignment, but you must modify the author's comments and output labels as necessary to make them compatible with your modifications to the code.

Attach your two modified files (do not attach donlist.h as that should not be modified in this assignment) to Assignment 6 in WorldClassRoom.
