a. find median of list
The most straight forward way is to sort the list then the middle element will be the median. 

b. find the kth largest number of list. 
Similar to the above question, we can sort the list (ascending) first, then the kth element will tbe the result. 

c. sorting algorithm has complexity higher than O(n), so, it will very hard if possible to reduce the complexity to linear time.
