'''
Given a file with one record per line, write a program for the following tasks
a. Randomly select roughly 10% of the records 
b. Randomly select exactly n of the records. 
c. Randomly select exactly n of the records in linear time.
'''
# Steps: 
# 1, get the total number of lines in the file 
# 2, create a random array with 10% and n of total records. 
# 3, scan the file again and output the line that matches the random number. 
# Sorry, implementation not tested.
