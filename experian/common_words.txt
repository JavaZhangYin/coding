# Given two files with words, write a program to find their common words.
# My solution is to use the set data structure. The following steps will be used: 
# 1, split sentences into words and put them into a set for the two files. 
# 2, do a set intersection on these two sets
# 3, output the result. 

from sets import Set 
file1 = open('file1.txt')
file2 = open('file2.txt') 

set1 = Set([])
set2 = Set([])

for line in file1:
    words = line.strip().split(' ')
    for word in words:
        set1.add(word) 

for line in file2:
    words = line.strip().split(' ')
    for word in words:
        set2.add(word)

common_words = set1 & set2

for word in common_words:
    print word
